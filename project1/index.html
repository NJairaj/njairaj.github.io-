  <h2 align="center">Jamaica</h2>
<p>
   <i><strong>Jamaica</strong></i>, a Caribbean island nation, has a lush topography of mountains, rainforests and reef-lined beaches.
    Many of its all-inclusive resorts are clustered in Montego Bay, with its British-colonial architecture,
    and Negril, known for its diving and snorkeling sites. Jamaica is famed as the birthplace of reggae music,
    and its capital Kingston is home to the Bob Marley Museum, dedicated to the famous singer.

    <i>Dunn's River Falls</i>
</figcaption>
    <p>
       Dunn's River Falls is a major Caribbean tourist attraction that receives thousands of visitors each year. It is one of Jamaica's national treasures.
       Globally, it is as well-known as Reggae and equally stimulating. There are few places where the Arawak name "Xayamaca" - land of rivers and springs - is more apt.
       The Spaniards called the area "Las Chorreras" - the waterfalls or springs - and it is truly one of the most beautiful spots on the island. A stone's throw from Ocho Rios,
       one of Jamaica's fastest growing resort centres, Dunn's River Falls is unique. Described as a living and growing phenomenon, it continuously regenerates itself from deposits
       of travertine rock, the result of precipitation of calcium carbonate from the river, as it flows over the falls. The small dome-shaped cataracts are usually associated with
       thermal spring activity found in limestone caves. This, combined with its location near to the sea, gives Dunn's River the distinction of being the only one of its kind in the
       Caribbean, if not the world.

<figcaption> <i>Blue Mountains</i> </figcaption>
   <p>
       The Blue Mountains are the longest mountain range in Jamaica. They include the island's highest point, Blue Mountain Peak, at 2256 m (7402 ft).From the summit, accessible via a
       walking track, both the north and south coasts of the island can be seen. On a clear day, the outline of the island of Cuba, 210 km (130 mi) away, can also be seen. The mountain range
       spans four parishes: Portland, St. Thomas, St. Mary and St. Andrew.
       The eastern side of the lush green island of Jamaica is dominated by the Blue and John Crow Mountains National Park. The park was designated a UNESCO world heritage site in 2015 due to
       its unique and diverse flora and fauna, much of it endemic to Jamaica. Magnificently undeveloped, this mountain paradise is best explored on foot. Hiking the Blue Mountains is one of the
       most rewarding experiences to be had in Jamaica.

       <i><strong>Sea change in Jamaica's reefs</strong></i>
       Lines of staghorn coral are being grown at a nursery inside the Oracabessa Bay Fish Sanctuary as part of efforts to rescue Jamaica's coral reefs and fish population.
       After a series of disasters in the 1980s and 1990s, Jamaica lost 85 per cent of its reefs. In the past decade, more than a dozen grassroots-run coral nurseries and fish
       sanctuaries have sprung up to combat the decline. As conservation efforts gained momentum, corals and tropical fish have slowly started reappearing in Jamaican waters.
