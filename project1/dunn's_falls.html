       Dunn’s River Falls is different than most waterfalls in the fact that you can actually climb the waterfalls. The falls are 180 feet high and 600 feet long
       that lead out the Caribbean Sea. This type of waterfall is called a travertine waterfall and there are few in the world and the only one in the Caribbean that
       empties into the sea.
<br></br>
       Dunn’s River Falls is a living natural wonder. The falls are continuously growing and reshaping. calcium carbonate from the river and travertine
       rock are deposited as the water flows over the falls. The result is hundreds of small dome-shaped cataracts or rock like obstacles the waterfall flows around and over.
<br></br>
       Climbing the waterfalls is a popular tourist activity and is often, but not exclusively, performed with the help of tour guides from the park. It takes about 1-1.5 hours
       to climb with short breaks for photographs & video recordings taken by the guides. There are also stairs, alongside of the falls, for those who do not want to get wet or are
       unable to manage the rocky, uneven terrain of the actual waterfall.
