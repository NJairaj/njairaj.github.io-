        The peak of the Blue Mountain sits at a majestic 2256 m (7402 ft), and is made all the more dramatic for the fact that it is possible to see the sea from the top
        (and from several points on the hike up there). This elevation has a dramatic effect on the climate which is usually several degrees cooler and much damper than at sea level.
        It is possible to leave Kingston or the coast wearing shorts, and require a coat, hat and umbrella long before the summit is reached. Regardless of fitness levels, there is something
        for everyone in the Blue Mountains and indeed everyone should make time to visit this area of outstanding natural beauty. It is possible to drive or take a pre-booked taxi to all of the
        hikes mentioned here.

        The hike to the peak of the Blue Mountain should be on the to-do list of every visitor to Jamaica. The track is well marked and not too steep, but it is a long walk and people who are less
        than fit might find it difficult. The most popular way to hike to the peak is to spend the night near Penlyne Castle at either Jah B’s or Whitfield Hall, and start out in the early hours hoping to
        reach the peak by sunrise. The hike from Whitfield Hall to the peak is circa 10km (six miles) and involves a 1000m (3000ft) gain in elevation. Done at a brisk pace, the summit can be reached in about
        two and half hours, although a leisurely stroll with frequent stops for photos and food can take twice that. A round trip of between five to eight hours is normal.
<br></br>
        As the trail ascends high into the mountains, it is fascinating to observe the changing vegetation – the Elfin Wood near the peak is a magical place. One final word:
        ignore the people who tell you it is possible to see Cuba from the summit – you’ll be lucky to have a cloudless day.
